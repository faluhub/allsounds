# AllSounds
AA, but with sounds.

Yes, there are alot of sounds, but there are atleast `3` sounds for each mob/animal, that's why the only hard part is to hit and kill every entity.

## FAQ

Q: Do you need to get *literally* all of the sounds?
A: No, the mod lists subtitles, so for example you won't need to get every single cave sound because they're all listed under `Eerie noise`.

Q: Isn't it super hard to wait for the ambient sound, hit and kill for every mob and animal in the game?
A: I guess, but it's still 3 sounds per mob/animal so you'll go through them pretty fast. Plus, you'll get some random ambient ones on the way.

Q: Why are there duplicates?
A: There are duplicates because sometimes there are different variations of an entity that makes sounds who are labeled under the same value in subtitles. For exmaple there are 2 `Bee buzzes` and multiple parrot sounds.

Q: Do UI sounds count?
A: Nope, sounds like when you click a button in the GUI, or when you get an advancement don't show up in the subtitles so they're not counted within the mod.

Q: Does it tell me when I get all of the sounds?
A: No, that's because I don't know what'll happen when you get all of them, so there's no way for me to tell where and what to add.
